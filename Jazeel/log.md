1. Downloaded and installed wamp server 
2. THe wamp server is running but the phpmyadmin screen is not getting displayed. I'm trying to fix the issue. It seems like having a conflict with IIS.

1. Started the laracast videos and thought of installing lavarel with composer.
2. Since the current version of php i had with wamp 2.1 was not suitable for laravel. Hence downloaded the latest php version and installed it
3. Faced a roadblock as wamp is not working now. Spend almost 4 hours trying to get it sorted.
4. Finally uninstalled wamp and installed laragon, which is working perfectly fine.
